## What is it?

RiasBot is a modular Telegram userbot running on Python 3 with an SQLAlchemy
database.

Based on [KensurBot](https://github.com/KenHV/KensurBot/tree/sql-extended), [Paperplane](https://github.com/RaphielGang/Telegram-UserBot) and
[ProjectBish](https://github.com/adekmaulana/ProjectBish) userbot. I made this just for myself with the module that I actually use.
